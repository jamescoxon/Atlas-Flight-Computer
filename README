Atlas Flight Computer

James Coxon (M6JCX)

This is the code that is used on the Atlas flight computer, an arduino based board used in high altitude ballooning.
The flight computer is currently being used for the BallastHalo missions - an attempt to develop a ballast system that maybe used on trans-atlantic flights, currently it is used on latex pinhole floaters
